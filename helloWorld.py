## Here's how you can print "Hello, World!" using a `main()` function in Python:

### Code
def main():
    # This is the main function where the program starts
    print('Hello World!')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # This ensures that main() is called only when this script is executed directly
    # A main function acts like a starting point for the program to be executed, and helps organize code
    main()


### Example Output:
```
Hello, World!
```

## This structure helps in organizing the code better, especially when your program grows more complex.
